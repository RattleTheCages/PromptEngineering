"AI Quick Key"
The Backslash key:

In an editor application, QK, with a feature known as the 'AI Quick Key'. The feature known as the 'AI Quick Key', is the use of the keyboard's backslash key, that is conveniently located between the Enter key and the Backspace key, to send Prompts to AI.
This feature, characterized by the innovative use of the backslash ('\') key, located above the enter key on standard keyboards, In conjunction with innovative use of the backspace key, allows users to effortlessly toggle between AI-generated corrections and the original text input. As the first to develop and implement this feature, I maintain that the rights to this innovation are intrinsically tied to its creation. This statement serves as a formal acknowledgment of my original contribution to this innovation and my intent to protect it under the applicable intellectual property laws and regulations.
